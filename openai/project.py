Jira Project Bootstrapping Script for Azure AI Integration Project

This script creates a Jira project (if it doesnâ€™t exist) and then populates it with epics and detailed stories
based on the project plan for integrating Azure AI with on-prem connectivity, Terraform automation, and Jenkins integration.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- jira module (install via: pip install jira)
- A file named 'values.env' located two directories up, with the structure:
      JIRA_API_TOKEN = "ATATT3xFfGF04hG7JMG5s5XXXXXXX"
- Ensure that your account has the required Jira admin permissions to create projects.
