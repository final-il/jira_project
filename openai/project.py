Jira Project Bootstrapping Script for Azure AI Integration Project

This script reads the Jira API token from a file (../../values.env), 
authenticates to Jira Cloud, creates a project (if it doesnâ€™t exist), 
and then populates it with epics and detailed stories based on the project plan.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- jira module (install via: pip install jira)
- A file named 'values.env' located two directories up with the structure:
      JIRA_API_TOKEN = "ATATT3xFfGF04hG7JMG5s5XXXXXXX"
- Your account must have Jira administrator permissions to create projects.
